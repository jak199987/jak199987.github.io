		<h1>Beginner Advice</h1>
		<p>One of the easiest strategies for beginners is to eliminate all the pieces that could be a threat in the end game, feesibly this isn't always possible but it is a good way to start out.
		Keep in mind each piece has a value for certain, the values are in this order king>queen>rook>bishop>knight>pawn. There are a few catches though, one of the important things to remember is 
		that the location of the pieces also determines its value, for example a pawn that is one square away from the other end of the board and almost ready to be promoted may be a more pressing 
		and important enemy to deal with than a docile knight that's lazing around.

		No, this isn't about a real fork. The term fork in chess refers to putting pressure onto two pieces with a single piece, for example if a knight jumps into a position where, on the next turn, he could
		attack the enemy bishop or the enemy rook, that move would be called a fork. No matter what you may call it however, a fork is one of the simplest techniques to put pressure with one piece and also force
		the other player to pick at their brain for a defensive counter measure to prevent both of their pieces from getting captured.
		<h2>Delay by Check</h2>
		<p>If you are ever put into an unfavorable position, remember to exploit the enemy king to regroup your pieces. Let's say your bishop was getting attacked by a knight and there is nowhere to move your knight because 
		all the other locations your knight can move to are being controlled or blocked. Let's also say you have a queen in one of the tiles that your knight can jump to, she is blocking the escape for your knight, to 
		get your knight to safety and move your queen out of the way, you can use your queen to put the enemy king in check. This way, she moves out of your knight's way while your opponent takes one turn to readjust their pieces
		and get their king out of check. However, when pulling this move you should always look two steps ahead, because you may just be putting another piece into a risky position if you aren't being careful.
		</p>
		<h2>Double Check</h2>
		One of the simplest moves, yet probably impractically hard to actually use against a good opponent is the double check. It involves you moving one piece so that two or more of your pieces are placing the enemy king into check,
		an example would be a knight in the way of a bishop that you have lined up against the enemy king, if you moved that knight so it would put the enemy king into check and the bishop would also automatically place the enemy in check,
		both of your pieces are putting the enemy in check. There are two advantages to this, the first advantage is that neither of your pieces are in danger for the duration of that one turn because the king would be attacked if either
		of those pieces were to be captured. The other advantage is that the king will be forced to move, as there is no move that the enemy can make to block both of the methods that you just used to place the enemy king into check.
