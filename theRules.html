		<h1>The Rules</h1>
		<p> There are few rules in chess, instead all the rules are in the pieces and their limitations. In chess, the rules are centered around the king and what conditions the king has to be kept in to continue the game and what conditions need to be met to reach a Checkmate or Stalemate. The rules of the king that concern the game are simple: a player cannot leave his own king in check at the end of that player's turn (note: see check on the Pieces page (under King) if you are unfamiliar with the term), if a player cannot move any pieces without putting their king into check the game is a stalemate, if a player cannot get their king out of check on their turn the match is won by checkmate against that player.
