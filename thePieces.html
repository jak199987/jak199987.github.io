		<h1>The Pieces</h1>
			<p>There are six diversified pieces on the Chess board, the King, the Queen, the Rooks, the Bishops, the Knights and the Pawns. At the start of the game, there are eight pawns, two knights, two rooks, two bishops, one queen and one king. Each piece has its own advantages and disadvantages, on this page we will explore each piece's simple nature and how it affects a game.</p>
		
		
		<h2>The Pawn</h2>

			</a>
			<p>Don't look down on them, the pawns may be the least valuable pieces but they have their own important uses.
			 There are eight pawns at the start of the game, they are positioned at the front of each army and are one of the two possible first move pieces, the
			 other piece that can be moved at the start of the game is the Knight. The pawn's movement is one tile forward. If that tile is blocked, the pawn cannot move. 
			 The pawn captures diagonally in front of it, but cannot move diagonally without capturing anything. There are three small tips that you should know about pawns
			 the first tip is that on a pawn's first move, it is allowed to move two tiles forward instead of one. The second tip is that if a pawn from the opposing side should move beside 
			 a pawn from your side it can be captured as if it were still standing diagonally across from your pawn, as well your pawn would end up in the direction of the 
			 enemy's pawn, diagonal to it's original location. The final tip for pawns is that they can be promoted, if a pawn manages to get all the way across the board, it can be promoted to any of the other pieces, a dramatic last resort for any player. Whew, there 
			 really is a lot to know about the smallest piece in the game, but let's move on.</p>
		
		<h2>The Knight</h2>

			<img class="undecided" src="images/knight.png" alt="A simple knight."/>
			</a>
			<p>One of the most offensive oriented pieces, the knight is ineptly named for its purpose, a knight's duty is to protect the king and though the knight can jump from 
			out of nowhere to protect the king from check, its true purpose is more like that of an assassin. The knight can move in 'L' shapes, two tiles in one direction and then change directions and move one 
			tile left or right to complete one move. One of the knight's most unique aspects is that it can tread overtop any piece, ally, enemy or empty space alike without affecting anything in
			its path. This is why the knight is also one of the first pieces that can be moved. The knight is definitely an anomaly among the chess pieces, but I've got no tips about it aside from
			the fact that it is useless nearer the end game. This is because the knight has lower range of movement than other end game pieces like the rook or bishop and when the board is clearer at the end game,
			the knight's advantage of jumping over pieces in a cluster is gone. It should also be known that one or two knights and a king at the end game cannot defeat their opponent by checkmate, there is simply no way
			for the knight with its movement patterns to be able to checkmate the enemy king without the use of other kinds of pieces. An early game suicide assassin is the appropriate role for a knight, its job is to clear the board
			and attempt to get an advantage earlier on in the game. 
			
		<h2>The Bishop</h2>
			<a href="http://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/bishop-chess-piece_44903">
			<img class="undecided" src="images/bishop.png" alt="A simple bishop."/>
			</a>
			<p>The bishop is one of the best pieces to keep a piece pressured, as the bishop can pressure from a radical distance and escape easily. The bishop's movement pattern is simply diagonals,
			it can move as close or as far as it wants along any adjacent diagonals. This also means that it will be restricted in movement during the early game as there are a lot of pieces early on and 
			they will constantly block the bishop and give you a headache. The bishop is also restricted in another way, it cannot switch the color of tile it is standing on, meaning that although the bishop can move
			in a wide range of motion, half the board is still off-limits for it. So, just like the knight, it is impossible for one bishop and a king to checkmate an enemy king, but with two bishops (one on each color of tile) it is still possible.
			
		<h2>The Rook</h2>
			<a href="http://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/tower-black-chess-piece-shape_44865">
			<img class="undecided" src="images/rook.png" alt="A simple rook."/>
			</a>
			<p>The rook is probably the most valuable non-royalty piece, because it is similar to the bishop in the way that it can put pressure from a distance. The rook starts out in the most unfavourable position for itself,
			the two corners of the board, this is unfavorable for the rook because starting there would restrict the movement of the rook drastically. The rook can move horizontally and vertically, with no restrictions on how far it can go, unless 
			there is another piece in the way of course. All other pieces can get out of the backline in one or two moves, but the rook requires either the pawn in front of it to get captured or for it two move up and then the rook will take two moves 
			to get out of the backline. But this slow start is fitting for such a dynamically powerful piece in the game, the rook obviously can pressure like nobody's buisness once the board gets cleared and it is one of the easiest pieces to manipulate the
			enemy king into checkmate. There is a small move that the rook can perform, castling, that involves the king. Castling will be explained later on, underneath the king's description.
		<h2>The Queen</h2>
			<a href="http://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/queen-chess-piece-black-shape_44502">
			<img class="undecided" src="images/queen.png" alt="A simple queen."/>
			</a>
			<p>The queen, royally she is the most important piece on the offensive front and has the biggest presence of all other pieces. This is because of her seemingly limitless range of movement, she is basically a rook and a bishop combined
			this means she can choose to move laterally, diagonally or vertically without any restriction aside from colliding with other pieces. Obviously she is the most important piece to keep safe, other than the king, and will often be the easiest piece
			to use when performing a checkmate. 
		<h2>The King</h2>
			<a href="http://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/king-chess-piece-shape_45124">
			<img class="undecided" src="images/king.png" alt="A simple king."/>
			</a>	
			<p>Finally, the piece that decides the game. The king. He is much weaker than you could ever imagine for a piece that is the most valuable and has to be kept safe. The king's movement is limited to one tile per turn and he can move to any adjacent 
			tile. The game is decided when the king is put into a position where no matter what move he would make in the next turn, there would be no way out of check in that one turn. The king starts out next to the queen and safely inside his pawn phalanx,
			but as the game begins he will quickly get left behind to fend for himself as the other pieces begin to fall. One of the reasons that the king should stay put, aside from the fact that if he gets caught the game is over, is because if he chooses to 
			stay in his spot, a king and rook may castle to gain a turn efficient change of position. The castle is where the rook in the corner and the king take equal steps toward each other and then swap tiles. If the king is castling with the rook further away,
			he will be moving two tiles before the switch. A king and rook may not castle into check or while in check.
